This library tries to provide a sdk for Threema Gateway for the go language. The api is implemented according to Threema's
api spec which can be found [here](https://gateway.threema.ch/en/developer/api).

This library implements the spec as of: 05.06.2025 (dd.MM.yyyy)

> [!CAUTION]
> Currently this library is not production-ready, as it lacks in testing, and it is not fully spec compliant.
